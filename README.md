# Grokenator
Status: Alpha

### Description
An attempt to create a grok chat interface with files using Grok2. Experimental project, but from sources the API for Grok is free, and it can do python code, so with a little enhancement, it could be nice setup, if not Grok 2 has Â£25 worth of free credit, switch it over to or incorporate also, that possibly will happen.

### Further Details
- Currently this is what it came up with at end of 1 session. 
- Back to othe projects for now, but its here for safekeeping, for, re-explore on grok2 or develop on other ai systems, later.
