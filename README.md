# Grokenator
Status: Alpha

### Description
An attempt to create a grok chat interface with files using Grok2. Bit of a hmm project, but apparently the API for Grok is free, and it can do python, so with a little enhancement, it could be nice, if not Grok 2 has Â£25 worth of free credit, switch it over to or incorporate also, that possibly.

### Further Details
- Currently this is what it came up with before insisting upon a API key, or something. Back to othe projects for now, but its here for safekeeping.
